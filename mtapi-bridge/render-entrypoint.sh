# Render PORT proxy — transparent wrapper for the mt5rest Docker service.
#
# ROOT CAUSE FIXED HERE:
#   Render's reverse-proxy routes all external HTTPS traffic (including the
#   /Ping health check) to the container on $PORT (typically 10000+ on the
#   free tier).  mt5rest always binds to port 80 and cannot be reconfigured
#   without patching the application.  Without this wrapper, Render's health
#   check never reaches mt5rest, the service is marked unhealthy and restarted
#   in a continuous loop, and the trading robot can never establish an MT5
#   connection.
#
# Fix strategy:
#   socat creates a lightweight TCP forwarder that listens on $PORT and
#   forwards every connection to localhost:80 where mt5rest is running.
#   This script starts the proxy in the background, then runs the original
#   container command in a supervised restart loop so that:
#     - mt5rest starts exactly as before (no application changes)
#     - Render's health check reaches /Ping through the proxy
#     - The trading robot's MTAPI_URL works through Render's reverse proxy
#     - Wine/dotnet transient startup failures are recovered automatically
#       without the container exiting (which Render would count as earlyExit
#       and mark the deploy as failed)
#
# Wine startup behaviour on Render free tier:
#   The mt5rest image runs a Windows .NET application under Wine.  Wine can
#   fail to initialise on the first attempt due to resource contention on
#   shared infrastructure.  The original "exec" approach caused the container
#   to exit on every Wine crash, triggering a Render deploy failure and a
#   restart loop visible in the dashboard.  The supervised loop below keeps
#   the container (PID 1 = this script) alive through transient Wine crashes,
#   restarting the child process automatically until Wine initialises
#   successfully and /Ping begins responding.
#
# FIX — earlyExit on Wine code=0 startup failure:
#   Wine/dotnet sometimes exits with code 0 (not just non-zero) when it fails
#   to initialise during container startup on Render's free tier.  The previous
#   logic treated any code=0 exit as a clean intentional shutdown and broke out
#   of the restart loop — causing the container (PID 1) to exit and Render to
#   record earlyExit on every new deployment.
#   Fix: only treat code=0 as intentional if the process ran for > MIN_UPTIME_S
#   seconds.  A code=0 exit within the first MIN_UPTIME_S seconds is treated as
#   a Wine startup crash and triggers the same 5s restart as a non-zero exit.
#   MIN_UPTIME_S=300 (5 min) covers all real shutdown scenarios while catching
#   any Wine initialisation failures that exit cleanly.
#
# SELF-KEEPALIVE (FIX — critical):
#   Render free tier sleeps a service after 15 minutes of no EXTERNAL traffic.
#   The trading robot pings /Ping every ~8 minutes, but if the robot itself is
#   restarting or in a backoff cycle, no pings arrive at the mtapi and the
#   Docker service sleeps.  Once asleep, the next robot reconnect attempt waits
#   60-90 s for Wine to cold-start, causing a "Connection Lost" spike in the
#   panel on every robot restart — a continuous reconnect loop.
#
#   Fix: a background loop inside this container pings its OWN /Ping endpoint
#   through Render's external URL every 8 minutes, independently of the robot.
#   Even if the robot is down for an hour the mtapi stays warm.
#   RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL must be set in render.yaml (already done).
#
# Local / Docker Compose usage:
#   When PORT is not set or equals 80, the proxy and external keepalive are
#   skipped entirely so local development and non-Render deployments are
#   unaffected.
