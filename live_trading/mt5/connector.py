"""
mt5rest HTTP Connector – GoldScalperPro v4

Direct MT5 connection via the mt5rest Docker bridge (no MetaAPI cloud).
Runs fully self-hosted on Render.

Required env vars:
    MTAPI_URL     – URL of the mt5rest Docker service
                    e.g. https://mt5.mtapi.io
    MT5_HOST      – broker server name  (e.g. AMarkets-Demo)
    MT5_USER      – MT5 account login number
    MT5_PASSWORD  – MT5 account password

mt5rest endpoints used:
    GET  /ConnectEx        – authenticate with broker, returns UUID conn id
    GET  /Disconnect       – close connection
    GET  /ConnectionStatus – check live connection
    GET  /AccountSummary   – balance, equity, margin
    GET  /OpenedOrders     – open positions
    GET  /PriceHistoryV2   – OHLCV candles (ISO datetime range)
    GET  /GetQuote         – current bid/ask price
    GET  /Ping             – liveness probe

    MT5 Broker-Session Keepalive — GoldScalperPro v4.

    The MTAPI /Ping (called from server.py) keeps the HTTP bridge process
    alive on Render free-tier, but does NOT send any traffic to the MT5
    broker socket.  After extended inactivity the broker can terminate the
    session, invalidating the conn_id and triggering a "Connection Lost"
    alert even though the HTTP bridge itself is healthy.

    This task fixes that by:
      1. Every `interval_s` seconds: calling /ConnectionStatus with the
         real conn_id, which flushes traffic through the MT5 broker socket
         and resets any broker-side inactivity timer.
      2. Proactive conn_id refresh: if the session is older than
         `refresh_age_s` (default 4 h), calls ConnectEx to get a fresh
         UUID before the broker can expire it.
      3. If the session is already dead: calls ensure_connected() to restore
         it silently, before the trading loop's next bar attempt would fail.

    Runs as a background asyncio.Task — never blocks the trading loop.
    Fails silently: any exception is logged and the loop continues.

    looks corrupted, keeps the first as a fallback so a real (if noisy)
    position is never silently dropped, but logs loudly either way.

    FIX: Also drops lone phantom rows whose volume exceeds _MAX_SANE_VOLUME_LOTS
    even when they carry a different (or zero/null) ticket from the real
    position, because in that case same-ticket deduplication cannot catch them.
    Such rows are always bridge artifacts — no retail gold account can open a
    1 000 000-lot position — and letting them through would write them into the
    Redis snapshot where the Telegram heartbeat treats them as a brand-new
    trade and fires a spurious "TRADE OPENED" notification with fabricated
    direction, size, and price.

    ROOT-CAUSE FIX (observed live): for a ticket this robot itself opened,
    mt5rest can return a *lone* row for that exact ticket with the volume/type
    fields corrupted (insane volume, type=None) — and, unlike the scenario
    above, this is not a one-off blip: it can repeat on every single poll for
    the rest of that position's life. Since OpenedOrders only ever lists
    currently-open positions, the ticket showing up at all — even corrupted —
    is itself proof the position is still open in MT5. Dropping it outright
    made get_open_positions() permanently blind to a real, live position,
    which let MAX_OPEN_TRADES be bypassed (observed: 4 simultaneous BUY
    positions opened one bar apart while MAX_OPEN_TRADES=1). If the caller
    passes `known_positions` (a {str(ticket): {"volume", "direction"}} map
    built from this robot's own trade log) and the corrupted ticket is a
    known one, repair only the volume/type fields from our own record instead
    of dropping the row — the ticket/openPrice from mt5rest are kept as-is.
    An unknown ticket with no independent sane lot field is still dropped
    exactly as before. A sane ``lots``/``closeLots`` field is independent
    evidence that the row is a real open position, so it is preserved even
    when the primary ``volume`` field is corrupted.
