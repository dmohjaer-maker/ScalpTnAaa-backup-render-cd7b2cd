"""
Live Trading Loop — async M5 candle-close event handler via mt5rest bridge.

Flow per tick:
  1. Wait for next M5 candle close
  2. Fetch 300 closed candles via mt5rest bridge
  3. Run decision engine (all 7 signal engines)
  4. Gate: RiskGuardian circuit breakers (daily loss / drawdown)
  5. Gate: max open positions + trade allowed + Telegram not paused
  6. Place order via mt5rest executor (with slippage control)
  7. Write robot_state.json for Telegram panel

Resilience improvements over baseline:
  • RiskGuardian — daily loss limit + peak drawdown stop, both configurable
    via env vars.  Guardian halts block trade entry without stopping the loop.
  • Exponential backoff — reconnect delay doubles on each consecutive failure
    (cap: 5 minutes) then resets to base on success.
  • Slippage control — SLIPPAGE_POINTS env var limits max fill deviation.
  • Trade-history persistence — trade log is restored from robot_state.json
    on startup, so the Telegram panel shows history after a restart.
  • Duplicate-entry safety — live MT5 position check already prevents
    double-entry (unchanged), but now also guarded by Guardian state.

        # position's row into a "lone row with an insane volume" (see
        # _dedupe_positions in mt5/connector.py) — a bridge-side glitch, not a
        # real second position. _dedupe_positions correctly discards that
        # garbage row as unreliable, but the side effect is that
        # get_open_positions() briefly reports the account as flat (raw
        # positions = []) even though a real position is still open in MT5.
        # If that happens to coincide with step 4's position check above, the
        # MAX_OPEN_TRADES gate (step 7) sees 0 open positions and lets a
        # second, unintended position stack on top of the first.
        #
        # Re-polling right here — seconds later, after the decision engine,
        # snapshot write, and all other gates have already run — is enough
        # time for a transient bridge glitch to clear. If a position now
        # shows up, we abort this entry rather than risk stacking a duplicate.
        # This costs one extra read-only mt5rest call only on the path that
        # is about to place an order; every other code path (trailing stop,
        # /close_all, panel snapshot) is untouched.
