"""
Regression tests — leverage must always come from real MT5 data.

Covers:
  1. connector.get_account_info() must not return 1 (old fake default) when
     leverage is missing from the bridge response.
  2. state_writer._account_dict must not default leverage to 100 when
     account_info carries no leverage field.
  3. MT5Service._normalize_state_to_snapshot must not default to 100.
  4. MessageFormatter.account_detail must show '—' instead of '1:0' when
     leverage is 0 (data not yet available).
  5. account_service.get_active_account and get_all_accounts must both
     propagate leverage from live MT5 data.
